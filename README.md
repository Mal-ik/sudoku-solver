## Overview

The project shows a visualization of the backtracking algorithm solving a sudoku board. You can load in puzzles of varying difficulty, and even attempt to solve them yourself!


## Demo

## How to Load Project

Clone the Github repo to a local directory and run the `main.py` file 

**Note**: Can drastically increase solve speed by switching off animations. Do so by setting “visuals” in `solver.py` to False. 


## Features

- Load in puzzles from four varying difficulties.
- Check your work as you solve
- See the optimized backtracking algorithm at work


## Technologies Used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE
- [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/) - Programming language 
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - Video game library 
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)/[BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - Used to pull/ manipulate board data from website
